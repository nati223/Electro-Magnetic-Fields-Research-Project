# Electro-Magnetic-Fields-Research-Project
Here we present a research project in Electro-Magnetic Fields course (2nd year Electrical Engineering - Tel Aviv University)
in which we analyze numerically, using the moments method (see theoretical background files), the charge distribution and capacitance over
an equi-potential PEC plates.

The code is an approximated analysis tool, not always yielding the expected theoretical results.
During the research, we confornted in some occasions results with significant relative errors. A lot of the challenge is deep understanding of
the physical assumptions we had to make in the realization of our algorithm and how they are reflected in it.
We hope you will enjoy the reading.

In this repository you will find:
1. Theoretical background of the moments method, from which we derived our algorithm of analysis.
2. Guiding question which we were requested to answer.
3. Our research paper, adressing the questions along with our results and conjectures.
4. Two python fiels (warning: they take long time to run, the second file will run approximately 40 minutes on an average computer), one for each
section of the research task.


The project was graded with 100/100.
